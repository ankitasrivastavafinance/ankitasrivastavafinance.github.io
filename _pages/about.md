I am an Adjunct Lecturer of Finance at Bentley University , where I instruct undergraduate courses in introductory finance (FI 118) and the principles of accounting and finance (FI 305). My academic background is rooted in mathematical risk management and quantitative finance, complemented by extensive industry experience in portfolio strategy and risk analytics.

Previously, I served as a Graduate Research Assistant at Georgia State University, providing research assistance for the study "Changes in the Distribution of Earnings Volatility," published in The Journal of Human Resources. My professional background includes roles as a Quantitative Portfolio Strategist and Quantitative Risk Analyst at PNC Financial Services Group , where I led the engineering of core investment strategies and bank-level portfolio risk analytics.
